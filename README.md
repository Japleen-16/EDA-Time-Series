# EDA-Time-Series
EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis of real time data in python. In this colab assignment I have done some analysis on Tesla's share price using different python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, using datetime module etc. I have also used pandas_datareader package which gives me access to up-to-date remote data for pandas and I got Tesla's share price information from 2017 till march of 2022.
The data is stored in a dataframe named df_tesla and various observations are made using the data and graphs in python.
